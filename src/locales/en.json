    "goal_title": "🎯 Goal",
    "goal_text": "To automatically detect DeepFake videos by dividing the face into regions and tracking temporal changes within each part.The system analyzes frame-by-frame variations to identify unnatural inconsistencies or distortions that indicate video manipulation.",
    "tech_title": "🧠 Technology",
    "tech_text": "Built using YuNet for face detection and Temporal Transformer Networks for sequential frame analysis. The system divides the face into temporal regions, extracts intensity and residual features between consecutive frames, and applies patch embedding with efficient self-attention to achieve accurate DeepFake classification.",
